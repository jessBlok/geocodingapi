This is a sample Angular app by Jess Blokland. 
I use Bootstrap to style a responsive horizontal form with custom CSS radio buttons and checkboxes.
The app connects to the Google Maps Geocoding API to return location coordinates for a queried address. Routing is done with the ui-router.
It also features animations via nganimate on ngshhow/nghide.
